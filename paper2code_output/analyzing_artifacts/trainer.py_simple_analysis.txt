 ### File: trainer.py

#### Objective
The objective of the `trainer.py` file is to train the model using the specified training loop, including loss computation and optimizer updates. The training loop will be responsible for updating the model's parameters based on the loss calculated on the training data.

#### Key Components
1. **Model Initialization**: The model architecture defined in `model.py` will be initialized in this file.
2. **Optimizer Initialization**: An optimizer such as Adam or SGD will be used to update the model parameters.
3. **Training Loop**: The loop will iterate over the dataset, compute the loss, and update the model parameters.
4. **Loss Computation**: The loss function will be defined based on the type of task (e.g., Binary Cross-Entropy for classification tasks).
5. **Logging and Metrics**: Metrics such as loss and other relevant metrics will be logged during training.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Import the model, optimizer, and other necessary libraries.
2. **Load Configuration**: Load configuration parameters from `config.yaml`.
3. **Initialize Model**: Instantiate the model from `model.py`.
4. **Initialize Optimizer**: Set up the optimizer (e.g., Adam with the specified learning rate).
5. **Training Loop**:
   - Iterate over the dataset in batches.
   - Forward pass: Compute the predictions using the model.
   - Compute the loss: Calculate the loss between the predictions and the ground truth.
   - Backward pass: Compute the gradients of the parameters with respect to the loss.
   - Update the parameters: Use the optimizer to update the parameters based on the computed gradients.
6. **Logging**: Log the loss and other relevant metrics at each epoch.

#### Pseudo-code
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from utils import log_metrics

class Trainer:
    def __init__(self, model, config):
        self.model = model
        self.learning_rate = config['training']['learning_rate']
        self.batch_size = config['training']['batch_size']
        self.epochs = config['training']['epochs']
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=self.learning_rate)
    
    def train(self, dataset):
        self.model.train()
        total_loss = 0
        for epoch in range(self.epochs):
            for batch in dataset:
                inputs, labels = batch
                self.optimizer.zero_grad()
                outputs = self.model(inputs)
                loss = self.compute_loss(outputs, labels)
                loss.backward()
                self.optimizer.step()
                total_loss += loss.item()
            avg_loss = total_loss / len(dataset)
            log_metrics({'loss': avg_loss}, 'train_log.txt')

    def compute_loss(self, outputs, labels):
        criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
        return criterion(outputs, labels)
```

#### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The `Trainer` class initializes with the model and configuration parameters. It sets up the optimizer using the specified learning rate.
- **Training Loop**: The `train` method iterates over the dataset in epochs and batches. For each batch, it performs a forward pass, computes the loss, and updates the model parameters using backpropagation and the optimizer.
- **Loss Computation**: The `compute_loss` method defines the loss function as Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits.
- **Logging**: The training log is updated at each epoch with the average loss.

This logic ensures that the model is trained effectively, with the parameters being updated based on the computed loss, and the training progress is logged for analysis.
